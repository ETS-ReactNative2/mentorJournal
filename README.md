Journal for projects with iFit mentor.

Message to Chase:
I'm finishing up my computer engineering degree at USU. I started off mechanical then switched to computer after my first coding class. I'm fairly confident with c/c++, python, vdhl/verilog, bash scripting and webscraping. I've been teaching myself JS/TS, HTML and CSS via MEAN stack pet projects. My goal would be to learn more about full-stack development, noSQL databases, hardware programming, or automation. Level of interest is probably in that order. I would definitely love some guidance in either of those.

MEETING SET for April 3rd at 12p MST.

Notes:
I’ve started a few pet projects out of general interest and for resume builders. There are a few that would be awesome to finish up and I think that they might be great structure for this program. One example is a webscraping script that pulls mushroom data from Wikipedia. It would be awesome to develop a basic taxonomy database web-app type deal. Either that or if Mike has something more productive in mind or related to iFit in mind.

Through iFit I really enjoyed working on bash scripting. I made 4 scripts to pull logs from the wolf app and one to install adb platform tools and add the terminal command to the path. That was my first github/developer addition.
- Look over these and see how my process was?
- I’m also very interested in your feedback for my resume and which direction I should be headed in with education and applying for jobs.
- Walk me through one of your projects.

Goals:
- Learn how industry development works from concept to completion
- Start and FINISH a full-stack project
- Use GitHub and branching for features

Questions:
- Maybe use the ($50/mo, $600/yr) for web hosting costs?
- Or any books/resources you recommend?
